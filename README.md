# Loan-Defaulter
Given features of a customer account in banks, predict whether a person will default or not?
Every loan has a max_dpd column against it - it is the max of days past due on all instalments of the loan. This is what deﬁnes if a loan has defaulted or not. You can look at 30 days past due as the deﬁnition of default. 
The problem statement is to design a model to predict whether a user will default.
